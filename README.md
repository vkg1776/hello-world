This is the first task to get acquainted with github


I am just getting into understanding github. I am currently learning to code using Python.
Learning is fun. It gives my brain a reason to strive and grow. This course is going good so far.
Branching is important as copies are made of main and edited in its own silo before it can be accepted to main.
